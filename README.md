# ChatGPT NetSuite Support

Turn ChatGPT into a focused NetSuite support assistant for Accounting and Finance teams.

This repo contains a versioned prompt + configuration pack that you can install into a **ChatGPT project** with project-only memory. Once installed, your team gets a reusable workspace that:

- Acts like a NetSuite-fluent support consultant  
- Helps troubleshoot errors, design saved searches, and improve workflows  
- Uses simple commands (like `GO`) so non-technical users can activate it  

To get started:

1. Create a new ChatGPT project  
2. Upload the `.md` files from the latest release  
3. Type `GO` in a new chat inside that project
